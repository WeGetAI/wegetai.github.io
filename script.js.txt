Additional Files and Notes

Images and Icons:



Place your logo in the images folder with the name logo.png or update the code accordingly.

For the hero section background, include an image named hero.jpg in the images folder.

Social media icons can be placed in the icons folder (facebook.png, twitter.png, etc.) or use font icons like Font Awesome.

Google Maps API:



Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the iframe source with your actual Google Maps API key to display the map correctly.

Google Analytics:



In the Analytics script, replace 'UA-XXXXX-Y' with your unique Tracking ID provided by Google Analytics.

Contact Form Functionality:



Currently, the contact form is static. To make it functional, you'd need to implement backend processing using a language like PHP, or use a service like Formspree or Basin.

Social Media Links:



Update the href attributes in the social media links with your actual profiles.
